### QuickWebShortcuts

This branch of the plugin contains a minified version.  
This branch does not have a graphical config dialog and settings have to be changes in the src/Config.h
file, after making changes you have to recompile your project.

By removing unnecessary dependencies and handling configuration at compile time
the file size is significantly smaller and less code has to be executed.
